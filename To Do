1.	Make the ie and eg italics – i.e. and e.g. 
2.	One Space between sentences 
3.	Cites – no need to define books and websites citations – use the full citation everywhere
4.	Make analysed to analyzed 
5.	For Para 67 – see if we can look for citation for this in Meyers report. If not, we might want to go through the NDAs  
6.	Para 71 – see if we are able to add the diagram on entities
7.	Para 90 – add the point to Thacker Interview list – that entities in 2018 and 2019 do not match up – maybe because of name change - done
8.	Para 107 – see if we can make a box and whisker plot for this using the ERI comp numbers
9.	Para 78 - add as two separate fn, one for the first quote and another for second quote (one from Plaintiff , another from Lewis report) - done
10.	Para 96 - If Jorge asks, connect COA to damages number.
11.	Remove title from the tables for damages #2
12.	132(3) - Check if Staiger says something like this in first report – Staiger has this in his responsive report (para 36, maybe we can cite to that)
13.	Footnote 183 -- check website & maybe find something better saying corporate projections should be taken with a grain of salt (maybe look at Reference Manual as well)
14.	Please keep in mind of stuff being defined after they are referenced to
15.	Check other places where we're making statements that are more legal & note any questions to ask Thacker (TC)

18.	Fn 189 – Add cites to academic lit

22.	Fn 87 – Ask Eugenia
23.	Replicate Spreadsheet
